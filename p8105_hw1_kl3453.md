# Problem 1

### 1. “Load the ‘moderndive’ libary…”

``` r
library(moderndive)
```

- *For future reference, you can name blocks of code for identification
  when R throws errors when knitting. ie. it’s a good idea to name the
  above code as “r setup” because you are ‘setting up’ your markdown by
  importing appropriate libraries.*

- *You can also use “include=FALSE” within the brackets (ie. {r setup,
  include=FALSE}) to hide a block of code.*

### 2. “…and use the following code to load the ‘early_january_weather’ dataset.”

Write a short description of the dataset using inline R code; accessing
the dataset help file can be informative. In your discussion, please
include:

- the variables in this dataset, including names / values of important
  variables
- the size of the dataset (using nrow and ncol)
- the mean temperature”

``` r
data("early_january_weather")

# Short description - Variables in Dataset
#   The file was accessed through the "Envrionment" tab by double clicking on the dataframe. Of the variables, 1 is "chr" type, 4 are "int" types, 9 are "num" types, and 1 is "POSIXct" type (some kind of time format). The 4 int type variables (year, month, day, hour) record the time and seem to be summarized by the "POSIXct" type "time_hour" by combining all 4 variables into one. The 9 "num" types are all some measurement of the climate (temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib) supposedly relating to flying conditions. The final "chr" type seems to be the names of airports (i think "EWR" for "Newark").

# Short description - Size of Dataset
#   The dataframe appears to have 358 rows (nrow = 358) of information each with 15 variables (ncol = 15).

# Short description - Mean Temperature
#summary(early_january_weather)
```

- ~~NOTE~~: “*hw1_df = data(”early_january_weather”)*” records the
  dataset as a single string “early_january_weather”. To access the
  actual data and utilize descriptive statistic functions in R (ie.
  “Summary(), head()”), remove the quotations.
  - **NEVERMIND**: the purpose of ‘data(“early_january_weather”)’ is to
    import the dataset from the library “moderndive” (which includes a
    lot of other datasets) so it is readily accessible in R. To ‘call’
    the dataset, simply refer it as early_january_weather (without the
    quotes) when using R. functions.
    - I was trying to assign a variable to the dataset. dont need to.
